                We store certain information that gets collected automatically
                at our end through cookies and other similar technologies. A
                cookie is a small string of information that a website that you
                visit transfers to your browser for identification purposes.
                Cookies can be used to follow your activity while using a
                website or across websites, and that information helps companies
                understand your preferences and tendencies, as well as improve
                and personalize your website experience. Some cookies are
                necessary to operate a website, while others can be functional,
                analytical, or used for marketing purposes, including targeted
                advertising (as discussed in more detail below). Cookies on our
                Site are generally divided into the following categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <em>Strictly Necessary Cookies</em>. These are required for
                  the operation of our Site. They include, for example, cookies
                  that enable you to log into password-protected portions of our
                  Site and cookies that save items in your online shopping cart.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Analytical/Performance Cookies</em>. These allow us to
                  recognize and count the number of users on our Site and
                  understand how such users navigate through the Site (e.g.,
                  when and which pages are visited, in what order the pages are
                  visited, and where a user is located). This helps improve how
                  the Site works, for example, by ensuring that users can find
                  what they are looking for easily.

                  performance of the Site and make it easier for you to use. For
                  example, cookies are used to remember that you previously
                  visited our Site and asked to remain logged into it. These
                  cookies qualify as persistent cookies because they remain on

                For residents of California, this section describes how we
                collect, use, and disclose, and/or “sell” (as defined under
                California law) the personal information of California
                residents, and the rights you may have under California law.
                These disclosures are intended to supplement this Privacy Policy
                with information required by California law.
              </p>
              <p>
                To understand what personal information we may have collected
                about you in the past 12 months, and from where we collected it,
                please see the section <em>Information We Collect</em> above.
              </p>
              <p>
                We collect this personal information, as further described in
                the <em>Our Use of Personal Information </em>section above, to
                operate, manage, and maintain our business, to provide our
                products and services, and to accomplish our business purposes
                and objectives.
              </p>
              <p>
                We may share personal information with the third parties listed
                above in the section{" "}
                <em>Our Disclosure of Personal Information</em>. Below, we have
                provided more detail regarding the two ways we share your
                personal information: (a) “sales” of information and (b) general
                disclosures of information for a business purpose.
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>“Sales” of Information</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                We have marked “sales” in quotation marks because a “sale” under
                California law broadly includes any disclosure of information in
                return for any value. This value does not need to be monetary,
                like in a traditional sale. For example, a “sale” can be when a
                business provides information collected through cookies to an
                advertising network that it has hired to promote its own ads—but
                then the advertising network is able to use the cookie data
                provided for its own purposes, outside of this particular
                business relationship.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the past 12 months, we may have “sold” the following
                categories of personal information to the following third
                parties: <em>Internet Activity </em>and <em>Inferences</em> to{" "}

                <li>
                  <strong>Portability</strong>. You have the right to request
