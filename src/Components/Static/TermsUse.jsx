                by Zeyr Fineri (collectively, the “<strong>Service</strong>”).
                This is a binding agreement.{" "}
                <strong>
                  If you do not agree to all of these terms, you are not
                  authorized to use the Service and you must promptly cease
                  using it. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be
                  bound by the terms.

              <p>
                <strong>
                  By agreeing to these Terms, you expressly agree to the
                  arbitration of all Disputes as further described below.

                Any controversy, allegation, or claim that arises out of or
                relates to the Service, these Terms, or any additional terms,
                whether heretofore or hereafter arising (collectively, a “

                one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form
                of a representative or class proceeding. In the event the
                prohibition on class arbitration is deemed invalid or
                unenforceable, then the remaining portions of the arbitration
                provisions will remain in force.

                      order has been processed and shipped, you will receive a

                      reduce the quantity of any order to be filled or products
                      to be provided to you that may result in a violation of

                      suggest or imply that any or all of our mobile messages
                      are sent using an automatic telephone dialing system
                      (“ATDS” or “auto-dialer”). Message and data rates may

                      <em>User Opt-Out</em>. If you do not wish to continue
                      participating in the Program or no longer agree to this

                      from Zeyr Fineri in order to opt out of the Program. You
                      may receive an additional mobile message confirming your
                      decision to opt-out. You understand and agree that the

                      texting words other than the word STOP or verbally
                      requesting one of our employees to remove you from our
                      list, is not a reasonable means of opting-out.

                      <em>Duty to Notify and Indemnify</em>. If at any time you
                      intend to stop using the mobile telephone number that has
                      been used to subscribe to the Program, including canceling
                      your service plan or selling or transferring the phone
                      number to another party, you agree that you will complete
                      the User Opt-Out process set forth above prior to ending
                      your use of the mobile telephone number. You understand
                      and agree that your agreement to do so is a material part
                      of these Terms. You further agree that, if you discontinue
                      the use of your mobile telephone number without notifying
                      Zeyr Fineri of such change, you agree that you will be
                      responsible for all costs (including attorneys’ fees) and

                      assists in the delivery of the mobile messages, as a
                      result of claims brought by individual(s) who are later
                      assigned that mobile telephone number. This duty and
                      Agreement shall survive any cancellation or termination of
                      your agreement to participate in any of our Programs. YOU

                      <em>Program Description</em>. Without limiting the scope
                      of the Program, users that opt-in to the Program can

                      sale of products, services, and events.

                      <em>Cost and Frequency</em>. Message and data rates may
                      apply. The Program involves recurring mobile messages, and
                      additional mobile messages may be sent periodically based
                      on your interaction with Zeyr Fineri.

                      <em>MMS Disclosure</em>. The Program will send SMS TMs

                      support MMS messaging.

                      <em>Our Disclaimer of Warranty</em>. The Program is
                      offered on an “as-is” basis and may not be available in
                      all areas at all times and may not continue to work in the
                      event of product, software, coverage, or other changes
                      made by your wireless carrier. We will not be liable for
                      any delays or failures in the receipt of any mobile
                      messages connected with this Program. Delivery of mobile
                      messages is subject to effective transmission from your
                      wireless service provider/network operator and is outside
                      of Zeyr Fineri’s control.

                      <em>Participant Requirements</em>. You must have a

                      be using a participating wireless carrier, and be a
                      wireless service subscriber with text messaging service.
                      Not all cellular phone providers carry the necessary
                      service to participate. Check your device capabilities for
                      specific text messaging instructions.

                      in contract, tort, statute, regulation, or otherwise,
                      shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of

                      Federal Arbitration Act, without regard to any choice or

                      <em>Arbitration Procedures</em>. In the event your concern
                      cannot be resolved informally, you and Zeyr Fineri agree
                      that, except as provided in Section 17(e) below, all
                      Disputes, (each a “<strong>Claim</strong>”), shall be
                      finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration,
                      which may be initiated by either party by sending a
                      written notice requesting arbitration to the other party.
                      Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and
                      binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted
                      under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of
                      JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is
                      initiated (the “<strong>JAMS Rules</strong>”) and under
                      the terms set forth in these Terms. In the event of a
                      conflict between the terms set forth in this Section 17 (
                      <em>Dispute Resolution</em>) and the JAMS Rules, the terms
                      in this Section will control and prevail.

              <p>
                Except as otherwise set forth in Section 17(e) below, you may
                seek any remedies available to you under federal, state, or
                local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration,
                both you and Zeyr Fineri will have the opportunity for discovery
                of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The
                arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s
                decision regarding the Claim, the award given, and the
                arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s
                decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is
                subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal
                Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an
                arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, (i) you
                and Zeyr Fineri may litigate in court to compel arbitration,
                stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify,
                vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the
                arbitrator; and (ii) the arbitrator’s decision shall be final,
                binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has
                jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the
                arbitrator fails to follow applicable law.

              <p>
                IN THE CASE OF ARBITRATION AND WHERE PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU ARE
                AGREEING TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT TO ASSERT OR
                DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS. YOUR RIGHTS WILL BE DETERMINED BY A NEUTRAL
                ARBITRATOR AND NOT A JUDGE OR JURY. YOU ARE ENTITLED TO A FAIR
                HEARING, BUT THE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES ARE SIMPLER AND MORE
                LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. ARBITRATOR DECISIONS ARE
                ENFORCEABLE AS ANY COURT ORDER AND ARE SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED
                REVIEW BY A COURT.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <em>Location</em>. The arbitration will take place in the City
                  and County of Los Angeles, California, United States of
                  America, unless the parties agree to video, phone, or internet
                  connection appearances.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Limitations</em>. You and Zeyr Fineri agree that any
                  arbitration shall be limited to the Claim between Zeyr Fineri
                  and you individually. YOU AND Zeyr Fineri AGREE THAT (i) THERE
                  IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A
                  CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (ii)
                  THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT
                  IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE
                  ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (iii) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED
                  WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Exceptions to Arbitration</em>. You and Zeyr Fineri agree
                  that the following Claims are not subject to the above
                  provisions concerning binding arbitration: (i) any Excluded
                  Dispute; (ii) any Claim related to, or arising from,
                  allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or
                  unauthorized use; and (iii) any claim for equitable relief. In
                  addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an
                  individual action in small claims court for Claims that are
                  within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction in lieu of
                  arbitration.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Arbitration Fees</em>. If you initiate arbitration for a
                  Claim, you will need to pay the JAMS arbitration initiation
                  fee. If we initiate arbitration for a Claim, we will pay the
                  costs charged by JAMS for initiating the arbitration. All
                  other fees and costs of the arbitration will be charged
                  pursuant to the JAMS Rules.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <em>Severability</em>. You and Zeyr Fineri agree that if any
                  portion of this Section is found illegal or unenforceable
                  (except any portion of Section 17(e)), that portion shall be
                  severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full
                  force and effect. If Section 17(e) is found to be illegal or
                  unenforceable then neither you nor Zeyr Fineri will elect to
                  arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of Section
                  17(e) found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim
                  shall be exclusively decided by a court of competent
                  jurisdiction within the City and County of Los Angeles,
                  California, United States of America, and you and Zeyr Fineri
                  agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

                    <li>

                      Terms may not be assigned without Zeyr Fineri’s prior
                      written consent, and any attempted unauthorized assignment
                      by you shall be null and void.

                    <li>
                      <em>Severability</em>. Except as otherwise provided in
                      Section 17(g), if any part of these Terms is determined to
                      be invalid or unenforceable, then that portion shall be
                      severed, and the remainder of the Terms shall be given
                      full force and effect.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <em>Attorneys’ Fees</em>. In the event any litigation or
                      arbitration is brought by either party in connection with
                      these Terms, except as otherwise provided in Section
                      17(f), the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
                      from the other party all the reasonable costs, attorneys’
                      fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party
                      in any legal action relating to these Terms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <em>No Waiver</em>. Our failure to enforce any provision
                      of these Terms shall in no way be construed to be a waiver
                      of such provision, nor in any way affect our right to
                      enforce the same provision at a later time. An express
                      waiver by Zeyr Fineri of any provision, condition, or
                      requirement of these Terms shall not be understood as a
                      waiver of your obligation to comply with the same
                      provision, condition, or requirement at a later time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <em>Equitable Remedies</em>. You acknowledge and agree
                      that Zeyr Fineri would be irreparably damaged if the terms
                      of these Terms were not specifically enforced, and
                      therefore you agree that we shall be entitled, without
                      bond, other security, or proof of damages, to appropriate
                      equitable remedies with respect to any breach of these
                      Terms, in addition to such other remedies as we may
                      otherwise have available to us under applicable laws.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <em>Entire Agreement</em>. These Terms, including the
                      documents referenced in these Terms, constitutes the
                      entire agreement between you and Zeyr Fineri with respect
                      to the Service and supersedes any and all prior agreements
                      between you and Zeyr Fineri relating to the Service.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <em>Transfer</em>. We may transfer our rights and
                      obligations under these Terms to another organization but
                      this will not affect your rights or our obligation sunder
                      these Terms.
