              </p>
              <p>
                At AMIRI, we&nbsp;stand against injustice and systemic racism
                and&nbsp;have made contributions to the NAACP Legal&nbsp;Defense
                and Educational Fund, BLMLA, and Black Visions Collective. These
                contributions will now become a dedicated part of our budgets.
              </p>
              <p>
                We understand this action and ongoing initiative is not enough.
                The fact remains that until justice is actualized through
                ongoing vigilance and commitment none of this will ever be
                enough.
              </p>
              <p>
                Black lives not only matter but are directly responsible for the
                cultural, intellectual, and artistic renaissance that our
                industry continues to benefit from today.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have initiated internal dialogue to utilize our
                infrastructure, expertise, and resources to&nbsp;support the
                black community including an open invitation for insight and
                outreach via <strong>community@amiri.com</strong>.&nbsp;
              </p>
              <p>
                We are committed to listen, learn, take action, and join in
                supporting organizations that are leading the fight for real
                change.
